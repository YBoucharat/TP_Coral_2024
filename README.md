# TP coral reef dynamics

## Description 
Here is given a coral reef construction kinematic model (new version of REEF; Husson et al., 2018; Pastier et al., 2019). 

During this course, you will get familiar with a kinematic model of coastal dynamics implying wave erosion and coral growth.
Kinematic? A model with an evolution according to a timestep

## Installation/Utilisation
You can test the model easily on binder using the following link: 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/YBoucharat/TP_Coral_2024.git/HEAD) <br>
Or git pull this repository.

The code is available in the REEF folder. A step-by-step jupyter notebook, 'Run_REEF.ipynb', allows to get familiar with the code, with some exercices. REEF source code is in the Library folder.
