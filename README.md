# TP coral reef dynamics

## Description 
Here is given a coral reef construction model (new version of REEF; Husson et al., 2018; Pastier et al., 2019), considering past eustatic sea-level, reef growth, marine erosion and clastic sedimentation of the eroded materials, modelling on an initial linear slope.

During this course, you will get familiar with a kinematic model of coastal dynamics implying wave erosion and coral growth.
Kinematic? A model with an evolution according to a timestep

## Installation/Utilisation
You can test the model easily on binder using the following link: 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/YBoucharat/TP_Coral_2024.git/HEAD) <br>
Or git clone this repository to have it on your machine : `git clone https://github.com/YBoucharat/TP_Coral_2024.git` <br>
If you choose to clone the repository and work on local, you will have to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your python terminal to install the environment.

REEF model is available in the REEF folder, and given with a step-by-step jupyter notebook, 'Run_REEF.ipynb', with some exercices. REEF source code is in the Library folder.
